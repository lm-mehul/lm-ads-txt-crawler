- maintain kafka queue to store domains.
- insert unique domains in kafka
- create a thread pool for parsing.
- Tracking Data
      Uncrawled, crawled, Parsed and unparsed data.
- store MD5 or similar hash in database.
- use bloom filter check hash present.
- avoid network calls, by storing file contents.
- The re direction logic can cause time overhead (need optimization in future).


populate and generate ads.txt and app-ads.txt files
multithreading
genrate hash
use batching to insert ata in database
proper error handling and logging
Use batching to read data

Open question - For isAdsTxtLinePresent, do we need to use all domains from DB or select domains from ads0txt-domains.txt file ?


Add metrics - total fails/discarded
minimize retries - by inserting domain as primary key
